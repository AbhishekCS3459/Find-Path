# Pathfinder

## Overview

Pathfinder is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and compute the shortest paths between cities using different modes of transportation (plane and bus). Utilizing the `vis-network` library for graph visualization and Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding, this application provides a user-friendly interface to manage cities and their connections dynamically.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Users can view cities as nodes and connections as edges with customizable attributes.
- **Dynamic City and Connection Management**: Add new cities and connections between them, specifying the distance and transport type.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Calculate the shortest path between two selected cities, displaying the route and total distance.
- **Confetti Animation**: Celebrate successful pathfinding with an engaging confetti animation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, `vis-network`, `vis-data`
- **Styling**: Custom UI components
- **Animation**: Canvas confetti for visual feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekCS3459/Find-Path
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd pathfinder
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and navigate to this URL to view the app.

## Usage

1. **Add Cities**: Enter a city name in the input field and click the "Add City" button to include it in the graph.
2. **Create Connections**: Select two cities, enter the distance, and choose the transport type (bus or plane) to create a connection between them.
3. **Find Shortest Path**: Select a starting city and an ending city, then click the "Find Path" button to calculate and visualize the shortest route.
4. **Visual Feedback**: Enjoy the animated path visualization and confetti celebration upon successful pathfinding.
